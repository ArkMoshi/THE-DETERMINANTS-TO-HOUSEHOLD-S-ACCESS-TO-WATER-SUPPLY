### project overview

purpose of the study was to access the determinants affecting household’s access to water supply. A case study that was conducted in Ubungo, Dar es salaam region. 

### Data sources

The data obtained from primary sources of information with the closed ended questionnaire comprised a total of 450 respondents involved to whom were obtained through a stratified random sampling method. 

### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning
- STATA - Data Anaylsis

### Data Preparation

This study will use quantitative data obtained directly from the household’s respondents. The data will be collected through personal interview whereby an enumerator will ask questions as they appear in questionnaire but in Swahili language version and record household’s response in Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect, a software tool designed for collecting data. Primary data will be collected with the aid of close ended structured questionnaire to collect socio-economic demographic household characteristics, water access and other factors potentially influencing water supply. 

### Explonatory Data Analysis

- What is the relationship between household’s socio-economic factors to affordability and availability of water services? 
- To what extent does existing infrastructure and geographical factors affects water access disparities among households? 
- What are the barriers and challenges hindering household access to water supply in Ubungo district?

### Data Analysis
Data analysis was guided by three specific objectives which are “To access socio-economic factors that affects water access to households”, This objective was tested using Binomial test, Chi-Square test and ANOVA. Another specific objective was “To evaluate the impact of infrastructures and geographical factors on households to access water supply” which was tested by using Logistic Regression Model. And lastly, was “To analyze the existing barriers and challenges hindering household’s access to water supply” which was tested by using ANOVA. 

### Results

1. The study has revealed that 87.8% of households in Ubungo district are connected to DAWASA water supply system and only 12.2% of the households use alternative water sources such as wells and buying water from their neighbors since they are not connected to DAWASA water supply systems, this shows that most of the residents in Ubungo district depend on water from DAWASA
2. Study findings it is clear that only being connected to water supply systems from DAWASA is not enough to get adequate water supply yet other related determinants such plumbing systems, water pressure, frequency of water distribution, number of authorities on water services provision, reliability of application and bill payments systems and equality in water distribution.


### Recommendations
- The Local Government Authorities should create a user-friendly environment which will motivate local and external donors to invest in water distribution, especially registered companies so that they invest in water distribution to the households of Ubungo district.
- DAWASA should start campaigns and advertise on the application process to make sure that the 12.2% of households are connected to DAWASA water supply systems.
- DAWASA should send water bills in hard copy to their respective households instead of online messages since not all DAWASA clients know how to read and operate mobile phones but also water bills should be sent in hard copies for reference and future uses. 
- Policy makers should disseminate the currently water policy as well as implement to the beneficiaries, thus not only be on blue print but also improve their living standard of people.
- Community members should be encouraged to be involved in cost sharing of water equipment such as water tap, water pipes, water tank, so that to improve water services as per water policy.

### Limitations
A case study  was conducted only in Ubungo, Dar es salaam region.
